# BEmoLex - Bangla Emotion Lexicon

We have developed a Bangla Emotion Lexicon named BEmoLex, consisting of 5336 lexicons across 9 emotion classes: Love, Joy, Surprise,
Anger, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, Trust, and Anticipation. A semi-automatic translation method was followed to generate the Bangla
lexicon by leveraging existing English lexical resources. To enhance the coverage and diversity of
the lexicon, we have manually incorporated handpicked strong emotive words, and expanded terms with Bangla synonyms.
